## How to REMOVE Alaterm

**WARNING:** If you uninstall the Termux app, you will lose all of Alaterm!
Re-installing Termux does not restore a prior installation of Alaterm.

Since Alaterm does not affect the operation of anything else,
a good working installation should be left in place,
unless your device is running low on storage and you do not need Alaterm.

To remove Alaterm: Download the installer files. Launch Termux.
Move the downloaded zip file into Termux, then unzip it.
If you installed to removable media, move the files onto that media.

Navigate to `alaterm-installer`. Then:

```
bash alaterm-installer remove
```

You will be asked for confirmation, twice.
